# What are Web Components

![bg left:30%](./images/bg.jpg)

- A set of standardized technologies that allow developers to create reusable custom elements with encapsulated functionality.

### Key Technologies:

- Custom Elements: Define new HTML elements.
- Shadow DOM: Encapsulates styles and markup to prevent them from affecting the rest of the page.
- HTML Templates: Define chunks of markup that can be reused without rendering immediately.

# Why Use Web Components?

![bg right:30%](./images/bg-4.jpg)

- Reusability: Create components that can be reused across different projects without dependencies on specific frameworks.
- Encapsulation: Prevent styles and scripts from interfering with the global scope, reducing conflicts and bugs.
- Interoperability: Can be used with any JavaScript framework or vanilla JavaScript, making them future-proof.

---

# Web Components vs. Frameworks

- Framework Independence: 
  - Web components are not tied to any specific framework, they are built on browser-native APIs.
- Longevity and Stability: 
  - Web components are built on web standards, ensuring they will be supported long-term without needing to adapt to framework-specific updates.
- Performance: 
  - Web components can be lightweight and optimized, without the overhead of a framework.
- Learning Curve: 
  - Web components can be simpler to learn for those familiar with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, compared to learning an entire framework.
